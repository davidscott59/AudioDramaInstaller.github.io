# Welcome to my release website

Audio Drama is a lightweight audio playback program designed for users who want flexible control over sound effects and music files. Whether you need to trigger multiple sounds at once, play sounds individually or step through them in a defined sequence, Audio Drama provides a simple, intuitive interface without the complexity of a fully automated show cue system.
This app is ideal for:
*	Beginners learning theater sound engineering
*	Users who need a straightforward audio player with functional control
*	Live event operators who require real-time cue manipulation and adaptability

# Main features:
*	Play multiple sounds simultaneously 
*	Control sounds individually or together 
*	Configure your sounds by defining start, volume settings, loop, pitch and fade for each sound.
*	Create setup files and save to your computer. 
*	There are sample audio files located in your DOCUMENTS folder called AudioDramaSoundEffects.

While originally built with theater in mind, Audio Drama is versatile enough for use in:
*	Concerts
*	DJ setups
*	Theme parks
*	Gaming environments
*	Educational settings

This application is <strong>FREE</strong>. However, if you would like to donate a little something to help me in my development process, you may do so in the About section of the app.
