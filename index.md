# Welcome to my release website

Audio Drama is a program designed to be used for applications where the user wants to be able to play effects files or music files either several at once or individual files, or sequentially one at a time. Its target audience is for individuals just learning theater sound engineering, or individuals who need a simple audio player to play their sound effects and to have some level of control of their functionality, but not to be a full automated show cue program. This software is particularly well-suited for live events because it allows for real-time control and manipulation of cues, adapting to the needs of a specific performance on the fly. It can be used for a wide range of applications beyond traditional theater, including concerts, DJ player, theme parks, gaming and even educational settings.
Main features:
*	Play multiple sounds simultaneously 
*	Control sounds individually or together 
*	Configure your sounds by defining start, volume settings, loop, pitch and fade for each sound.
*	Create setup files and save to your computer. 
*	There are sample audio files located in your DOCUMENTS folder called AudioDramaSoundEffects.
