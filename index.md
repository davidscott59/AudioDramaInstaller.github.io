# Welcome to my release website
![Audio Drama](/AudioDrama1.0.0.1.png)

Audio Drama is a lightweight audio playback program designed for users who want flexible control over sound effects and music files. Whether you need to trigger multiple sounds at once, play sounds individually or step through them in a defined sequence, Audio Drama provides a simple, intuitive interface without the complexity of a fully automated show cue system.
This app is ideal for:
*	Beginners learning theater sound engineering
*	Users who need a straightforward audio player with functional control
*	Live event operators who require real-time cue manipulation and adaptability

# Main features:
*	Play multiple sounds simultaneously 
*	Control sounds individually or together 
*	Configure your sounds by defining start, volume settings, loop, pitch and fade for each sound.
*	Create setup files and save to your computer. 
*	There are sample audio files located in your DOCUMENTS folder called AudioDramaSoundEffects.

While originally built with theater in mind, Audio Drama is versatile enough for use in:
*	Concerts
*	DJ setups
*	Theme parks
*	Gaming environments
*	Educational settings

This application is <strong>FREE</strong>. However, if you would like to donate a little something to help me in the development process, you may do so in the About section of the app.

<strong>Install instructions:</strong>
1. The AudioDrama zip file contains all the files. Select this to downloaded the AudioDramasetup.zip to a temp location on your computer. (desktop, download, temp).
2. It is a good idea to run a antivirus scan on the files, as they may have gotten corrupted or infected from the download from the internet. Then run the installer
3. Windows may complain by popping up a message that it does not recognize the author. This is because the software has not been certified through Microsoft and is not being installed via their app store. You may disregard this warning and install the software.
4. The installer will place the executable in a folder called DaveTone\Audio Drama, and place a shortcut on your desktop. It will also create a folder called AudioDrama sound effects, and place this in your DOCUMENTS folder. Within this folder will be some sample mp3 files.
5. Please see the end user agreement (EULA) provided from the download site for further information regarding copyrights and usage.
